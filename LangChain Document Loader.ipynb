Editor, AI Models\\nIBM Think\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        What is LangChain?\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain is an open source orchestration framework for application development using large language models (LLMs). Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and AI agents.\\u202f\\n\\n\\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI\\xa0(genAI) more accessible to enthusiasts and startups in the wake of its widespread popularity. Advancements in accessibility for agentic AI are currently enabling a revolution in automation.\\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even AI\\xa0agents capable of robotic process automation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntegrations with LLMs\\n\\n\\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of artificial intelligence products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        How does LangChain work?\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\\n\\n\\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\\n\\n\\nImporting language models\\n\\n\\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\\nMany open source models, like Meta AI’s LLaMa, Deepseek's Deepseek-LLM, IBM's Granite and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face. IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\\xa0allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\\n\\n\\nPrompt templates\\n\\n\\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\\n\\n\\nChains\\n\\n\\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\\nThe most basic chain is\\xa0LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define\\xa0chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call\\xa0chain_example.run(“input”).\\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\\n\\n\\nIndexes\\n\\n\\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\\n\\n\\nDocument loaders\\n\\n\\nLangChain offers\\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications. This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\\n\\n\\nVector databases\\n\\n\\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\\xa0vector databases\\xa0represent data points by converting them into\\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\\n\\n\\nText splitters\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s\\xa0TextSplitters\\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval\\n\\n\\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\\xa0its\\xa0retriever\\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\\xa0Document’s as output.\\nWith LangChain, we can also build agentic RAG systems.\\xa0In traditional RAG applications, the LLM is provided with a vector database to reference when forming its responses. In contrast, agentic AI applications are not restricted to only data retrieval. Agenic RAG can also encompass tools for tasks such as solving mathematical calculations, writing emails, performing data analysis and more.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\n\\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of previous interactions (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\\xa0most recent exchanges.\\n\\n\\nTools\\n\\n\\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\\nLangChain tools\\xa0are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent pre-built LangChain tools include:\\n\\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustry newsletter\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\\n\\n\\n\\nGet curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

Unlike a simple prompt-response interaction with just an LLM, an agent powered by LangChain can think, plan, execute a sequence of actions, learn and adapt.\\nLangChain provides a streamlined user experience with a ready-made, extensible framework for creating AI agents, so there’s no need to build new tool selection logic, reasoning loops (such as for ReAct agents), observation/action tracking or prompt orchestration and formatting.\\nThe specific LangChain packages, classes and methods vary depending on the AI platform you intend to use. Some key components of the WatsonxLLM class that allow for communication with watsonx.ai models using LangChain include:\\nlangchain_ibm: The package responsible for the LangChain IBM integration. It is necessary to install this package to use any of the following classes and methods.ibm_watsonx_ai: The library that allows connection to watsonx.ai services like IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Pak for Data.APIClient: The main class of the ibm_watsonx_ai\\xa0library that manages the API service resources. The parameters include the API credentials and endpoint.WatsonxLLM: The wrapper for IBM watsonx.ai foundation models. This wrapper provides chain integration and is necessary to import. The parameters include the model ID, watsonx.ai API key, URL endpoint, project ID as well as any LLM parameters.ModelInference: The class that instantiates the model interface. The parameters include the model ID, watsonx.ai credentials, project ID, model parameters and more. Once instantiated, the model can then be passed into the class.invoke: The method that calls the model directly with a single prompt of string type.\\xa0generate:\\xa0The method that calls the model with multiple prompts of string type in a list.\\nAnother LangChain class for building AI agents with the integration of tool calling and chaining with\\xa0watsonx.ai models is ChatWatsonx. This class, which is leveraged in many of our tutorials, uses the bind_tools method to pass a list of tools to the LLM upon each iteration. These can include both custom and pre-built tools. To retrieve the AI agent response, the invoke method\\xa0can be used. Once the agent is invoked, the tool_calls attribute\\xa0of the response displays the name, arguments, id and type of each tool call made, if any.\\n\\n\\nLangGraph\\n\\n\\nLangGraph, created by LangChain,\\xa0is an open source AI agent framework that supports multi-agent orchestration and enables developers to build\\xa0agentic workflows\\xa0where different agents interact, specialize and collaborate.\\xa0\\nAt its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an\\xa0AI agent workflow.\\xa0Combined with the human-in-the-loop monitoring mechanism and a set of API and tool integrations, LangGraph provides users with a versatile platform for developing AI solutions and workflows including\\xa0chatbots, state graphs and\\xa0other agent-based systems.\\xa0\\nWith the langchain-mcp-adapters library, LangGraph agents can also use tools defined on model context protocol (MCP) servers. The mcp library allows users to build custom MCP servers as well. Essentially, MCP enables a secure connection between an AI system, such as an AI agent, and external tools. Thus, various LLMs can connect to the same tools and data sources given the standard MCP.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      AI Academy\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGo to episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        LangSmith\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nReleased in the fall of 2023, LangSmith aims to bridge the gap between the accessible prototyping capabilities that brought LangChain to prominence and building production-quality LLM applications.\\xa0\\nLangSmith provides tools to monitor, evaluate and debug applications, including the ability to automatically trace all model calls to spot errors and test performance under different model configurations. The use of LangSmith is not limited to applications built using the LangChain ecosystem. The evaluation of agent performance is done using LLM-as-a-judge evaluators. This observability\\xa0and these key metrics aim to optimize more robust, cost-efficient applications.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Getting started with LangChain\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain is open source and free to use: source code is\\xa0available for download on Github.\\nLangChain can also be installed on Python with a simple pip command: pip install langchain. To install all LangChain dependencies (rather than only those you find necessary), you can run the command\\xa0pip install langchain[all].\\nMany step-by-step tutorials are provided by IBM including LangChain tool calling, agentic RAG, LLM agent orchestration,\\xa0agentic chunking and more.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        LangChain use cases\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAI Applications made with LangChain provide great utility for a variety of use cases, from straightforward question-answering and text generation tasks to more complex solutions that use an LLM as a “reasoning engine.”\\n\\n\\nChatbots\\n\\n\\nChatbots are among the most intuitive uses of LLMs. LangChain can be used to provide proper context for the specific use of a chatbot, and to integrate chatbots into existing communication channels and workflows with their own APIs.\\n\\n\\nSummarization\\n\\n\\nLanguage models can be tasked with summarizing many types of text, from breaking down complex academic articles and transcripts to providing a digest of incoming emails.\\n\\n\\nQuestion answering\\n\\n\\nUsing specific documents or specialized knowledge bases (like Wolfram, arXiv or PubMed), LLMs can retrieve relevant information from storage and articulate helpful answers). If fine-tuned or properly prompted, some LLMs can answer many questions even without external information.\\n\\n\\nData augmentation\\n\\n\\nLLMs can be used to generate\\xa0synthetic data\\xa0for use in\\xa0machine learning.

These LLMs can be proprietary (such as OpenAI’s GPT models and Anthropic’s Claude models) or offer varying degrees of openness around pretraining data and usage restrictions (such as Meta’s Llama models, Mistral AI’s Mistral models, and\\xa0IBM’s Granite models).AI practitioners often need to adapt a pretrained LLM to suit a particular business purpose. But there are limits to the ways you can modify an LLM:Fine-tuning an LLM to understand a specific area of knowledge or skills typically involves expensive, resource-intensive training.There’s no way to incorporate improvements back to the LLM, and thus no way for models to continuously improve from user contributions.LLM refinements have typically required large amounts of human-generated data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to get.InstructLab follows an approach that punches through those limitations. It can enhance an LLM using far less human-generated information and far fewer computing resources than are typically used to retrain a model.InstructLab is named after and based on IBM Research’s work on Large-scale Alignment for chatBots, abbreviated as LAB. The LAB method is described in a\\xa02024 research paper by members of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and IBM Research.InstructLab is not model-specific. It can provide supplemental skills and knowledge fine-tuning to an LLM of your choice. This “tree of skills and knowledge” improves continuously from contributions and can be applied to support regular builds of an enhanced LLM.\\xa0The InstructLab project prioritizes fast iteration and intends to retrain models on a regular basis. Organizations can also use the InstructLab model alignment tools to train their own private LLMs with their own proprietary skills and knowledge.How to apply AI at the enterprise\\xa0 \\nHow does InstructLab work?The LAB method consists of 3 components:Taxonomy-driven data curation. Taxonomy is a set of diverse training data curated by humans as examples of new knowledge and skills for the model.Large-scale synthetic data generation. The model is then used to generate new examples based on the seed training data. Recognizing that synthetic data can vary in quality, the LAB method adds an automated step to refine the example answers, making sure they’re grounded and safe.Iterative, large-scale alignment tuning. Finally, the model is retrained based on the set of synthetic data. The LAB method includes 2 tuning phases: knowledge tuning, followed by skill tuning.The dataset grows through contributions of skills and knowledge, with each addition improving the quality of the model being tuned.\\xa0 \\n\\nRed Hat resourcesKeep reading\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is InstructLab different from other methods of training an LLM?Let’s compare InstructLab to the other ways of customizing an LLM to serve your domain-specific use cases.PretrainingPretraining represents the deepest level of model customization, and allows organizations to curate what training data shapes the models’ foundational understanding.\\xa0During pretraining, an LLM is trained to predict the next token using trillions of tokens of unlabeled data. This gets really expensive, sometimes requiring thousands of GPUs and months of time. Pretraining a highly capable LLM is only possible for organizations with significant resources.Alignment tuningAfter pretraining, LLMs undergo alignment tuning to make the model’s answers as accurate and useful as possible. The 1st step in alignment tuning is typically\\xa0instruction tuning, in which a model is trained directly on specific tasks of interest.\\xa0Next is\\xa0preference tuning, which can include reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this step, humans test the model and rate its output, noting if the model’s answers are preferred or unpreferred. An RLHF process may include multiple rounds of feedback and refinement to optimize a model.Researchers have found that the amount of feedback at this alignment tuning stage can be much smaller than the initial set of training data―tens of thousands of human annotations, compared to the trillions of tokens of data required for pretraining―and still unlock latent capabilities of the model.InstructLabThe LAB method emerged from the idea that it should be possible to realize the benefits of model alignment from an even smaller set of human-generated data. An AI model can use a handful of human examples to generate a large amount of synthetic data―then refine that list for quality―and use that high-quality synthetic data set for further tuning and training. In contrast to instruction tuning, which typically needs thousands of examples of human feedback, LAB can make a model significantly better using relatively few examples provided by humans.How is InstructLab different from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?The short answer is InstructLab and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solve different problems.RAG is a cost-efficient method for supplementing an LLM with domain-specific knowledge that wasn’t part of its pretraining. RAG makes it possible for a chatbot to accurately answer questions related to a specific field or business without retraining the model.\\xa0With RAG, knowledge documents are stored in a vector database, then retrieved in chunks and sent to the model as part of user queries. This is helpful for anyone who wants to add proprietary data to an LLM without giving up control of their information, or who needs an LLM to access timely information.\\xa0This is in contrast to the InstructLab method, which sources end-user contributions to support regular builds of an enhanced version of an LLM. InstructLab helps add knowledge and unlock new skills of an LLM.It’s possible to \"supercharge\" a RAG process by using the RAG technique on an InstructLab-tuned model.Learn more about RAG \\nWhat is Red Hat InstructLab on IBM Cloud?Red Hat AI InstructLab on IBM Cloud allows for contributions to an LLM without the need to own and operate hardware infrastructure.On its own, Red Hat InstructLab is an open source project that simplifies LLM development, enabling a cost-effective approach to align models with less data and fewer resources.IBM Cloud is an enterprise cloud platform designed for even the most regulated industries, delivering a highly resilient, performant, secure, and compliant cloud.Together, Red Hat AI InstructLab on IBM Cloud offers a scalable, cost-effective solution to simplify, scale, and secure the alignment of your LLMs to your organization’s unique use-cases.Learn more about Red Hat InstructLab on IBM Cloud \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHub\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe official Red\\xa0Hat blog\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the latest information about our ecosystem of customers, partners, and communities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep reading \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll Red\\xa0Hat product trialsOur no-cost product trials help you gain hands-on experience, prepare for a certification, or assess if a product is right for your organization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep reading \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep reading\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Istio?\\n\\n\\n\\n        Find out more about Istio, an open source service mesh that controls how microservices share data with one another.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead the article \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is CentOS Stream?\\n\\n\\n\\n        CentOS Stream is a Linux® development platform where open source community members can contribute to Red\\xa0Hat® Enterprise Linux in tandem with Red\\xa0Hat developers. \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead the article \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is KVM?\\n\\n\\n\\n        Kernel-based virtual machines (KVM) are an open source virtualization technology that turns Linux into a hypervisor.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead the article \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen source resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatured product\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRed Hat AI\\n\\nFlexible solutions that accelerate AI solution development and deployment across hybrid cloud environments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee all products \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlog post\\n\\nBringing intelligent, efficient routing to open source AI with vLLM Semantic Router\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nAn open platform for AI models in the hybrid cloud\\n\\n\\n\\nBlog post\\n\\nGPU-as-a-Service for AI at scale: Practical strategies with Red Hat OpenShift AI\\n\\n\\n\\nBlog post\\n\\nRed Hat Satellite 6.18: New AI, Management, and Security Capabilities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is llm-d?\\n\\n\\nWhat is distributed inference?\\n\\n\\nWhat is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\\n\\n\\nAIOps explained\\n\\n\\nWhat is AI security?

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/file-sample.docx'}, page_content='Demonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\n\\nThis document demonstrates the ability of the calibre DOCX Input plugin to convert the various typographic features in a Microsoft Word (2007 and newer) document. Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action.\\n\\nThere is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting.\\n\\nTo see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the “Add Books” button and then click “Convert”.  Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click “OK”.\\n\\n\\n\\nText Formatting\\n\\nInline formatting\\n\\nHere, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of embedded fonts.\\n\\nHere is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out  text. Then, we have a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.\\n\\nA paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with equal ease.\\n\\nFun with fonts\\n\\nThis document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be embedded in the output ebook during conversion. \\n\\nParagraph level formatting\\n\\nYou can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray background.\\n\\nFor the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.\\n\\nTables\\n\\nITEM\\n\\nNEEDED\\n\\nBooks\\n\\n1\\n\\nPens\\n\\n3\\n\\nPencils\\n\\n2\\n\\nHighlighter\\n\\n2 colors\\n\\nScissors\\n\\n1 pair\\n\\nTables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. While you may run into trouble with the occasional table, the vast majority of common cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated in this section. Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row.\\n\\nNow let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.\\n\\nCity or Town\\n\\nPoint A\\n\\nPoint B\\n\\nPoint C\\n\\nPoint D\\n\\nPoint E\\n\\nPoint A\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint B\\n\\n87\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint C\\n\\n64\\n\\n56\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint D\\n\\n37\\n\\n32\\n\\n91\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint E\\n\\n93\\n\\n35\\n\\n54\\n\\n43\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, we see a table with special formatting in various locations.

The table is displayed horizontally centered.\\n\\nOne\\n\\nThree\\n\\nTwo\\n\\n\\n\\nFour\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the left is a table inside a table, with some cells merged.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe end with a fancy calendar, note how much of the original formatting is preserved. Note that this table will only display correctly on relatively wide screens. In general, very wide tables or tables whose cells have fixed width requirements don’t fare well in ebooks.\\n\\nDecember 2007\\n\\nSun\\n\\n\\n\\nMon\\n\\n\\n\\nTue\\n\\n\\n\\nWed\\n\\n\\n\\nThu\\n\\n\\n\\nFri\\n\\n\\n\\nSat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStructural Elements\\n\\nMiscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, endnotes, dropcaps and the like. \\n\\nFootnotes & Endnotes\\n\\nFootnotes and endnotes are automatically recognized and both are converted to endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.\\n\\nDropcaps\\n\\nD\\n\\nrop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.\\n\\nLinks\\n\\nTwo kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThere are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.\\n\\nIf no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 the second level and so on.\\n\\n You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. \\n\\n\\tDemonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\t1\\n\\n\\tText Formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tInline formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tFun with fonts\\t2\\n\\n\\tParagraph level formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tTables\\t3\\n\\n\\tStructural Elements\\t5\\n\\n\\tFootnotes & Endnotes\\t5\\n\\n\\tDropcaps\\t5\\n\\n\\tLinks\\t5\\n\\n\\tTable of Contents\\t5\\n\\n\\tImages\\t7\\n\\n\\tLists\\t8\\n\\n\\tBulleted List\\t8\\n\\n\\tNumbered List\\t8\\n\\n\\tMulti-level Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\tContinued Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImages\\n\\nImages can be of three main types. Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.\\n\\nThe final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.\\n\\nCentered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. \\n\\nGenerally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.\\n\\nLists\\n\\nAll types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.\\n\\nBulleted List\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nNumbered List\\n\\nOne, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nMulti-level Lists\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nThree\\n\\nFour with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly.\\n\\nFive\\n\\nSix\\n\\nA Multi-level list with bullets:\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nThis bullet uses an image as the bullet item\\n\\nFour\\n\\nFive\\n\\nContinued Lists\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nAn interruption in our regularly scheduled listing, for this essential and very relevant public service announcement.\\n\\nWe now resume our normal programming\\n\\nFour')]"
